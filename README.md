# Job-Search
As a recent graduate of a coding bootcamp, users will need an app that will successfully help them to gain employment.
<br>
Users are able to enter desired job they are looking for and location into our search. They will be presented with matching jobs in a list. Users are able to click the apply button to apply for any of the listed jobs - this will take them directly to the site to apply. Jobs on the site were pulled from Muse and GitHub Jobs APIs.
